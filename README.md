You can print it with a gray stone. prepared with 6 holes for buttons. just use a pcb board to solder on buttons and glue it in.
or you print it without the base. i prepared the files so, that you can fit a microcontroller like a teensy 3.1 in there. and then programm a fixed sequence without the need of the buttons.

Infos to the code:
currently on button 1. She will turn her head open her mouth and say "Ola". flash her eyes and then turn her head back again.
the other buttons let you test servo positions etc. button 6 plays the next sound in line, with different spanisch sentences.
I have plans for making her say different sentences. it might require a capacitor or something. the sound module seems to get overloaded when the motor is running and sound is playing at the same time.

for the sound i used this website:

with the settings: Spanish (Spain), Elvira (Female)



The project uses:
- 2 standard micro servo motors:

- neopixel led for the eyes. you could use just on and glue it behind the eyes. print the eyes in translucent petg filament and it will illuminate nicely.
